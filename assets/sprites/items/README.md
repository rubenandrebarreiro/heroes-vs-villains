The term 'Living Computer' should be understood as an approximation. It seems to be part living being, part highly developed machine. It looks like a small box, about the size of a Terran house brick at largest. It's generally thought to be sentient, miniaturized, portable supercomputer, although its true nature and origins are unknown. It possesses wondrous powers and abilities not understood even by their wearers. These range from teleportation (they can summon Boom Tubes) to energy manipulation! ```` [See more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Box) |
